ans 1 . RGBA stands for "Red Green Blue Alpha". It is a color model used in digital image processing and computer graphics that defines a color using four components: red, green, blue, and alpha. The first three components (red, green, and blue) represent the color itself, while the fourth component (alpha) represents the opacity or transparency of the color.

Ans 2 To get the RGBA (Red Green Blue Alpha) value of any image using the Pillow module in Python, we can use the getdata() method of the Image class. The getdata() method returns a sequence-like object that contains the pixel values of the image in RGBA format.
for eg. 
from PIL import Image

# Open the image file
image = Image.open("example.png")

# Get the pixel data as an RGBA sequence
pixel_data = image.getdata()

# Print the first pixel value (RGBA)
print(pixel_data[0])

Ans 3. n the context of image processing libraries such as Pillow, a "box tuple" refers to a tuple of four integer values that represents a rectangular region within an image. The four values in the tuple represent the left, upper, right, and lower boundaries of the rectangle, respectively.

The format of the box tuple is (left, upper, right, lower), where left and upper specify the x and y coordinates of the top-left corner of the rectangle, and right and lower specify the x and y coordinates of the bottom-right corner of the rectangle. The coordinates are measured in pixels, with the origin (0, 0) being the top-left corner of the image.

Ans 4. To find out the width and height of an image loaded as an Image object in a Jupyter notebook using the Pillow module, we can use the size attribute of the Image object. The size attribute returns a tuple containing the width and height of the image, respectively.

Ans 5. To get an Image object for a 100x100 image that excludes the lower-left quarter of the image, we can use the crop() method of the Image object.

Ans 6 . After making changes to an Image object using the Pillow module, we can save the modified image as a new file using the save() method. The save() method takes the file name and format as arguments.

Ans 7 Pillow's shape-drawing code is included in the ImageDraw module, which is part of the Pillow module. The ImageDraw module provides methods for drawing shapes, lines, text, and other graphical elements on Image objects.

To use the ImageDraw module, we need to create an ImageDraw object from an Image object, using the ImageDraw.Draw() method.

Ans 8. The Pillow's ImageDraw module provides the drawing methods for creating shapes, lines, and other graphical elements. ImageDraw module provides the Draw object, which is used to draw on an Image object.

To get an ImageDraw object, we need to call the ImageDraw.Draw() method on an Image object. The ImageDraw.Draw() method returns an ImageDraw object that can be used to draw on the Image.
