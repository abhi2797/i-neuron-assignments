 destPath = input(‘Enter the absolute path of the destination folder: ‘)

for foldername, subfolders, filenames in os.walk(sourcePath):
 for filename in filenames:
 if filename.lower().endswith(fileExtType):
 #print(foldername + ‘\\’ + filename)
 copySourcePath = os.path.join(foldername, filename)
 #print(copySourcePath)
shutil.copy(copySourcePath, destPath)
